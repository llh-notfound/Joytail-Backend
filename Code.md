Front-end

1. Proof of Concept
1.1 Front-end
In the front-end proof-of-concept of the pet one-stop platform-Joytail project, the technology selection is centered around the core framework, UI design and style management.
1.1.1  Core Framework 
First of all, we identified the core framework of Joytail as Vue 3 and UniApp.
Vue 3 is the most advanced and widely recognized front-end framework, and its Composition API not only greatly enhances the flexible separation and combination of code logic, but also improves the reusability of components and the efficiency of team collaboration. With Vue 3's responsive system, Joytail dramatically reduces the cost of state maintenance and business logic maintenance in complex interfaces. At the same time, Vue 3's excellent developer tools ecosystem allows teams to build, debug and analyze performance with less effort.
UniApp's advantage lies in the cross-end development of small programs. Thanks to its concept of “write once, run on multiple ends”, Joytail can maximize the reuse of core business logic, page structure, and component styles in WeChat applets, H5, and other multi-end scenarios, which greatly reduces the human cost of subsequent multi-platform adaptation and maintenance. UniApp provides conditional compilation, platform differentiation processing, life cycle management and other mechanisms, which enable Joytail to flexibly respond to the functional differences and ecological characteristics of different platforms.
In terms of compatibility, UniApp's project structure and page organization are highly compatible with Vue, allowing the team to give full play to their existing Vue development capabilities.
1.1.2 UI design and style management 
In terms of UI design, Joytail attaches great importance to visual unity, all icons are in SVG vector format, and iconfont.css is generated by automated tools and integrated into the project style system. This not only ensures a high degree of unity in icon style and brand recognition, but also significantly reduces the volume and bandwidth consumption of image resources.
In terms of style management, Joytail fully adopts Sass/SCSS as CSS preprocessor. Through variables, nesting, Mixin, loops and other Sass features, the team realized the variable and modular management of global styles such as theme colors, fonts, spacing and so on. Each page and component has an independent SCSS file, but shares style resources through global variables and Mixin, which not only ensures flexible reuse of styles, but also facilitates subsequent brand upgrades and theme switching.The nesting and inheritance features of Sass enable the team to more clearly organize complex hierarchical style structures, reduce redundant code, and improve the maintainability and readability of style code.
Finally, in order to adapt to different devices, Joytail uses the native responsive units (rpx) of the WeChat applet ecosystem for layout and size control. This enables the applet to automatically scale according to the device's screen width, guaranteeing a consistent visual experience across different terminals. For example, interfaces such as product cards, community post streams, etc. have their sizes and spacing set by rpx to ensure that they can be displayed correctly under small-screen cell phones, large-screen cell phones, tablets and other devices.

2.Design and construction of your system
2.1 Front-end
2.1.1 Front-end page structure
1.Page structure 
Joytail is divided into the following six modules according to business modules. The home page serves as the entrance to the platform, providing core functions such as category navigation and popular recommendations; the personal center module contains sub-functions such as pet information management, profile editing, pet management, pending matters, order management, community interaction, account tools, service support, etc.; Pet product sales module realizes the core functions of e-commerce such as search and filtering, pet product list, detail display, shopping cart, etc.;Pet medical services module covers the Pet medical module covers the pet medical home page and doctor details display; pet insurance service module provides insurance product list, insurance product display and purchase jump service; pet community module includes community home page, dynamic release, dynamic details and personal community page.
2. Page Routing 
Joytail adopts the built-in page routing mechanism of UniApp framework to realize global unified page management. All pages are declared centrally in src/pages.json, and the path, title and navigation bar style of each page are configured through this file, and the page path is the routing address. For jumping between pages, Joytail distinguishes between tabBar pages and normal pages. The bottom main navigation bar is configured in pages.json, which contains three core pages: “Home”, “Shopping Cart” and “My”, which are located at the main entrance of the project, the shopping cart module and the personal center respectively. shopping cart module and personal center. When users switch between the main navigation bar, the uni.switchTab method is used to ensure that the page state is synchronized with the navigation bar. For non-main navigation bar pages, such as product details, community dynamics, order management, etc., page stack jumping is realized by uni.navigateTo.
2.1.2 Detailed structure of each business module
1. Home Page 
The page design of Joytail's home page (index.vue) combines the interaction habits of mainstream mobile products, with a categorized navigation area at the top, which displays the platform's main functional entrances (e.g., pet supplies, pet community, pet medical care, pet insurance, pet community, etc.) in the form of icon buttons. Each navigation item is bound with @click event, so that users can jump to the corresponding business module page with one click, realizing fast module switching. The middle part of the home page adopts the way of scroll-view list display, displaying the content areas of popular recommendations, quality hospitals, recommended insurance, community popularity, etc. The overall layout of the home page focuses on information layering and information display. The overall layout of the home page focuses on information layering and visual guidance, which not only ensures the prominence of the main navigation, but also takes into account the richness of the content and personalized recommendations, so that users can efficiently obtain the information they need and conveniently enter the major business modules.

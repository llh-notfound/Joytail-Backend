## 🎯 Slide 1: Technology Stack Architecture & Design Philosophy

### 📝 Slide Content:
**Title:** PetPal Backend: Modern Microservice-Ready Architecture Design

**Core Technology Selection Philosophy:**
- **Runtime Environment:** Node.js v20+ (Event-driven, high concurrency)
- **Web Framework:** Express.js (Lightweight, middleware ecosystem)
- **Data Storage:** Redis (In-memory database, multi-data structures)
- **Authentication:** JWT (Stateless, scalable)
- **API Design:** RESTful (Uniform interface, resource-oriented)

**Architecture Design Principles:**
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### 🎤 Speaker Notes (30 seconds):
"PetPal backend adopts a modern technology stack with Node.js as the core runtime, fully leveraging its event-driven and non-blocking I/O characteristics for high-concurrency processing. Express.js provides lightweight web framework support with a rich middleware ecosystem enabling rapid development of maintainable APIs. Redis serves as our primary data storage, with its diverse data structures perfectly matching our business scenarios. JWT implements stateless authentication supporting horizontal scaling. The overall architecture follows SOLID principles, ensuring code maintainability and scalability."

## 🎯 Slide 2: System Architecture Design & Data Flow

### 📝 Slide Content:
**Title:** Layered Architecture Design & Request Processing Flow

**System Layered Architecture:**
- **Presentation Layer:** RESTful API endpoints
- **Business Logic Layer:** Controller + Service pattern
- **Data Access Layer:** Redis abstraction layer
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Middleware + Utility libraries

**Core Design Patterns:**
- **MVC Pattern:** Separation of concerns
- **Middleware Pattern:** Cross-cutting concerns handling
- **Repository Pattern:** Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection:** Reduced coupling

### 🎤 Speaker Notes (30 seconds):
"Our system adopts classic layered architecture design with clear separation of responsibilities for each layer. The presentation layer handles API interface definitions, business logic layer processes core business rules, and data access layer provides unified data operation interfaces. Through MVC pattern we achieve separation of concerns, middleware pattern handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging. Repository pattern abstracts data access details, dependency injection reduces module coupling. This design ensures system testability, maintainability, and scalability."

## 🎯 Slide 3: Authentication System & Data Flow Examples

### 📝 Slide Content:
**Title:** JWT Authentication Mechanism & Core Business Data Flow

**JWT Authentication Process:**
1. **User Login** → Credential Verification → JWT Token Generation
2. **Token Carrying** → Authorization Header in each request
3. **Token Verification** → Middleware parsing and validation → User info extraction
4. **Access Control** → Role-based access control

**Data Storage Strategy:**
- **User Sessions:** Redis Hash structure for user state storage
- **Shopping Cart:** Redis List structure for cart data implementation
- **Community Content:** Redis Set/Sorted Set for like counting
- **Caching Strategy:** Multi-level caching for performance enhancement

### 🎤 Speaker Notes (30 seconds):
"Our authentication system is based on JWT implementing stateless authentication. After user login, they receive an encrypted Token containing user information, and subsequent requests carry the Token through the Header for identity verification. Middleware automatically parses Tokens and extracts user information, implementing fine-grained access control. Data storage fully utilizes Redis's multiple data structures: Hash structures store user sessions, List structures manage shopping carts, Set structures handle community interactions. Multi-level caching strategy ensures rapid response for frequently accessed data."

### 🖼️ Visual Elements:
- **Login Authentication Flow:**
  ```
  User Login → Password Verification → JWT Generation → Token Return
      ↓
  Subsequent Requests → Token Verification → User Info Extraction → Permission Check → Business Processing
  ```
- **Redis Data Structure Application:**
  ```
  Hash: {user:123} → {id, name, email, role}
  List: {cart:123} → [item1, item2, item3]
  Set: {post:456:likes} → {user1, user2, user3}
  String: {token:xyz} → "jwt_token_content"
  ```
- **Data Flow Diagram:** Client ↔ API ↔ Redis
